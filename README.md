# graduate
A portfolio of my projects worked on during my graduate studies at the University of Oklahoma

Fall 2022:
Courses in computing structures and intelligent data analytics.
Projects from both classes are included in this repository.
Intelligent Data Analytics project involved data aggregation and experimentation with multiple regression models to predict U.S. superstore profits.
Models included decision tree, OLS, MARS, and SVM for all data and then for each subcategory of superstore product.
Computing Structures project involved implementing operations on binary search tree (inserting node, finding node, displaying raw data) given a text input file of commands.
Files: Project_112722_v3.R and project5.cpp

Fall 2023:
Course in database management systems. 
Files include individual project report pdf files and some .sql task files.

Fall 2024:
Courses in neural data science and artificial intelligence. 
Files include AI homework .py files and .ipynb files and report for neural data science final project. Also includes TRUExT paper from master's thesis project (however code cannot be provided due to privacy reasons).
