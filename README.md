A portfolio of my projects worked on during my graduate studies at the University of Oklahoma

Fall 2022:
Courses in computing structures and intelligent data analytics.
Projects from both classes are included in this repository.
Intelligent Data Analytics project involved data aggregation and experimentation with multiple regression models to predict U.S. superstore profits.
Models included decision tree, OLS, MARS, and SVM for all data and then for each subcategory of superstore product.
Computing Structures project involved implementing operations on binary search tree (inserting node, finding node, displaying raw data) given a text input file of commands.
Files: Project_112722_v3.R and project5.cpp

Fall 2023:
Database management systems project. Files include report pdf files and some .sql task files.
